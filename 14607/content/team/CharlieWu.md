Charlie is a senior and this is his ninth year in FIRST, joining the program due to his early inclination towards all subjects robotics related, starting FLL in fourth grade. He is one of the team captains and a veteran of FTC with five years of experience. He started the team with his dream of crafting a diverse robot-loving family and, when looking at our current team demographic, can confidently say that we have done it! In addition to FTC, Charlie dances urban hip-hop, is an officer for Jeffersonâ€™s Machine Learning Club, and is part of the Senior Computing Team. Charlie loves spending his free time brainstorming, designing, CADding, programming, and working to inspire the next generation of young students in STEM.
