Jason is a senior in his 3rd year of FIRST, and he developed a passion for robotics after discovering the technological wonder that is CAD. He is the Documentation and Outreach Lead, and his favorite parts about our robotics team are designing new parts, engaging with other robot-lovers, and teaching younger students. Besides robotics, Jason participates in TJâ€™s Machine Learning Club, Senior Computer Team, Dev Club, and Urban Dance Movement. He has an avid interest in computer science and dreams of using CS and robotics to help others. In his free time, he plays the violin, makes really cool spreadsheets, plays video games, and learns about faraway places and cultures from browsing Google Maps and traveling.
