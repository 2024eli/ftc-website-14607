Jason is a senior and this is his third year in FIRST, joining after being roped in by our ever-successfully persuasive Facebook post and has stuck around because he loves the interactive builder-robot experience. On top of that, he enjoys teaching younger students in STEM and robotics with his fellow team members. As a proud and dedicated member of this team, Jason can be spotted around the lab taking pictures with his trusty camera, creating intricate CAD, and racing back-and-forth between our inventory and the 3D printers. His favorite memory from FTC was his first ever mission: creating the team marker! Outside of FTC, Jason participates in Machine Learning Club, Senior Computer Team, Dev Club, Bridge Club, and Urban Dance Movement. Jasonâ€™s hobbies include programming, playing the violin, and making really cool spreadsheets (like the one he uses for scouting).
