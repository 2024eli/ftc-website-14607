Jason is a senior and this is his fourth year in FIRST, joining after being roped in by our ever-successfully persuasive Facebook post (see above) and has stuck around because he loves the interactive builder-robot experience. As a member of the Engineering and Build subteam as well as the Software Team, he assists the programming and he orchestrates (get it, because he does orchestra) the development of the mechanisms. He participates in ICT (Computer Team) and plays bridge!
