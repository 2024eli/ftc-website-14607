Anush is a freshman in his 1st year of FTC. His first experience with FIRST was in 4th grade when he participated in FLL. His passion for robotics was rediscovered in 6th grade, when he participated in VEX Robotics. He was fortunate enough to have the robotic parts stationed at his house, so Anush was able to work on building the robot outside of meeting times as well. Since then, his love for robotics and coding only grew. In addition to FTC, he is a shadow for a non-profit organization who has helped over 22,000 people (PASTA), is a certified 2nd degree instructor in taekwondo, and is playing soccer.
