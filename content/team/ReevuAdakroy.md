Reevu is a senior and this is his fourth year in FIRST, joining because he thought the program was super cool and an experience that would allow him to apply the knowledge he learned in school! He is part of the Design and Build subteams, where he designs and brainstorms robot subsystems. In his free time, he practices solving Rubik’s Cubes and his best time is 15 seconds and works out at the nearby recenter. Reevu’s favorite dessert is red velvet cake with cream cheese icing.
