Charlie is a senior and this is his ninth year in FIRST, joining the program due to his early inclination towards robotics; starting FLL in fourth grade. He is the founder & team captain of team 14607, and a veteran of FTC with five years of experience. He started the team with his dream of crafting a diverse robot-loving family, and when looking at our current team, can confidently say that we have done it! In addition to FTC, Charlie dances urban hip-hop with Jefferson's Urban Dance Movement troupe, is an officer for Jeffersonâ€™s Machine Learning Club, is part of the Senior Computing Team, and pursues advanced robotics autonomy research. Charlie loves spending his free time designing, CAD-ing, programming, and working to inspire the next generation of young students in STEM.
