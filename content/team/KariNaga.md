Kari is a senior and this is his fourth year in FIRST, joining after seeing the team’s convincing Facebook post advertising for new members and continued with the team because of all the fun memories we have made! As a member of the Software and Design subteams, he CADs, and designs the mechanisms as well as codes the robot. In school Kari participates in the Web Development Club and loves coding! Kari’s favorite activities outside of school are playing video games and occasionally writing programs.
