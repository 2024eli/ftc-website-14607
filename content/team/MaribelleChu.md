Working with a team of passionate members to promote and partake in STEM is her favorite part about FTC. Outside of FTC, Maribelle codes websites, plays soccer on her club and varsity school team, manages a library center for GIVE, listens to music, competes in Japan Bowl, composes songs, reads many books, and learns as much as possible. She is also a Leader for the Children’s Science Center Youth Advisory Board, where she has been volunteering since fifth grade. Her overarching goal is to benefit the earth’s environment through STEM.
