AJ is the captain of the team and senior in her 4th year of FIRST. She joined after competing in the class-wide IBET Robotics competition and discovering CAD and computer science! She's been passionate in STEM since her science bowl and olympiad years in middle school and has been striving to continue that path at TJ. In the past couple years, AJ has loved being able to connect with the community through outreach and teaching younger students. Outside of robotics, AJ is part of TJ's Varsity Girls Tennis team and has played the flute for the last 7 years. She also enjoys dancing, as an Urban Dance Movement club officer (iNite is super fun!), and reading when she has free time.
