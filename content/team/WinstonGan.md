Winston is a junior in his 6th year of FIRST, joining FLL at the start because he wanted to experience programming. By joining an FLL team in 5th grade, his interest in robotics grew and it led him to join the FTC program, seeking to learn more about robotics. He is very excited to experience his third year on the team. In his free time, Winston enjoys playing basketball, making music, writing fictional novels, and is involved in TJ's cyber patriot team and soccer team. He also likes pillows.
