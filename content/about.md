“A team of STEM geared individuals, ready to make changes in the World”

Barry Barlow, CIO Perspecta

## About the Team

Robot Uprising is the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) Robotics team based at the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST), the leading public high school in the United States. This is our fourth year as a team, and we currently have 11 members from 9th to 12th grade. In our first season we advanced to, and won two awards at the World Championship Tournament, and also won 5 other awards at state and regional levels. Last season, we won 13 awards at local and regional levels, and placed 1st seed in robot performance at the State Championship. Our season was unfortunately cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Our Mission

Our Team mission is to is to engage our community and help spread the values of FIRST as well as our passions in STEM. We do this by hosting outreach events and expanding our own community initiatives, among various other volunteer activities. We are proud of our extensive outreach, with over 1,000 recorded hours and over 30 STEM Events two seasons ago. This past season during the pandemic, our team created and hosted a total of 22 weeks worth of virtual camps teaching CAD, Arduino, and Python, reaching over 400 students nationally.

We also strive to acheive these goals:

1. ENGAGE our community by mentoring other teams, attending conferences, and volunteering at STEM events.
2. INSPIRE students by hosting workshops and summer camps, where we teach our custom robotics curriculum.
3. COMMUNICATE with mentors, other teams, and businesses to increase STEM interest in our community.
4. ACHIEVE excellence in robotics through a shadowing program that teaches team members coopetition, leadership, and teamwork.

## About FIRST

FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) Robotics is a global STEM organization that gives passionate students the opportunity to enrich their studies in all areas of STEM and build science, technology, and engineering skills. The theme of this year's season, FIRST RISE, aims to “inspire citizens of the galaxy to work together, strengthening and protecting the Force that binds us and creating a place where collaboration and collective wisdom can elevate new ideas and foster growth”. FIRST organizes STEM robotics competitions for students K-12, such as the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC), which engages high schoolers in a team competition to build a robot that completes a series of tasks on a playing field, and challenges them to promote STEM throughout their communities. Over 8,000+ teams from across the globe participate in FTC and its robotics challenges every year. Through this program, students develop vital skills in time management, planning, leadership, and teamwork. Last season, the FIRST progression of programs reached over half a million active participants from over 95 countries, and it only continues to grow.
