“A team of STEM geared individuals, ready to make changes in the World”

Barry Barlow, CIO Perspecta

## About the Team

Robot Uprising is a FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) team based at and affiliated with Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST), one of the leading public high schools in the United States. This is our third year as a team, and we currently have 12 members from 9th to 12th grade. In our first season we qualified and doubly placed in the FTC World Championship Tournament and also won 5 other awards at state and regional levels. Last season, we won several awards at local and regional levels, and placed 1st in robot performance at the highest level of competition. Our season was unfortunately cut short due to the COVID-19 Crisis.

### Our Mission

Our Team mission is to  is to engage our community and help spread the ideas of FIRST as well as passion in STEM. We do this by attending and hosting outreach events and expanding our own initiative, among various other activities. We have extensive outreach, with over 1,000 recorded hours and over 30 STEM Events just this past season.

We also strive to acheive these goals:

1. ENGAGE our community by mentoring other teams, attending conferences, and volunteering at STEM events.
2. INSPIRE students by hosting workshops and summer camps, where we teach our custom robotics curriculum.
3. COMMUNICATE with mentors, other teams, and businesses to increase STEM interest in our community.
4. ACHIEVE excellence in robotics through a shadowing program that teaches team members coopetition, leadership, and teamwork.

## About FIRST

FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) Robotics is a STEM program that allows passionate students to enrich their studies in all areas of STEM and build science, technology, and engineering skills. The theme of this season, FIRST RISE, aims to “inspire citizens of the galaxy to work together, strengthening and protecting the Force that binds us and creating a place where collaboration and collective wisdom can elevate new ideas and foster growth”. FIRST organizes competitions to encourage students to learn more about STEM, such as the FIRST Technology Challenge (FTC), which engages high schoolers in a team competition to build a robot that completes a series of tasks as well as promote STEM throughout their community with outreach events. Through this program, students develop skills such as time management, planning, leadership, and teamwork, which are vital to their success in the FTC arena as well as in our futures. Last season, the FIRST program reached over half a million active participants from over 95 countries, and it only continues to grow. For more information, visit www.firstinspires.org.
