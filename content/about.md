“A team of STEM geared individuals, ready to make changes in the World”

Barry Barlow, CIO Perspecta

## About the Team

Robot Uprising is the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) Robotics team based at the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST), the leading public high school in the United States. 

This is our fourth year as a team, and we currently have 11 members from 9th to 12th grade. In our first season we advanced to, and won two awards at the World Championship Tournament, and also won 5 other awards at state and regional levels. Last season, we won 13 awards at local and regional levels, and placed 1st seed in robot performance at the State Championship. Our season was unfortunately cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

This season, we won the Think Award 1st Place and Motivate Award 2nd place at the Laurel Maryland Qualifiers. We will be continuing to go to competitions throughout the season. Look forward to more being added to the website!

### Our Mission

Our Team mission is to is to engage our community and help spread the values of FIRST as well as our passions in STEM. We do this by hosting outreach events and expanding our own community initiatives, among various other volunteer activities. We are proud of our extensive outreach, with over 1,000 recorded hours and over 30 STEM Events two seasons ago. This past season during the pandemic, our team created and hosted a total of 22 weeks worth of virtual camps teaching CAD, Arduino, and Python, reaching over 400 students nationally.

We also strive to acheive these goals:

1. ENGAGE our community by mentoring other teams, attending conferences, and volunteering at STEM events.
2. INSPIRE students by hosting workshops and summer camps, where we teach our custom robotics curriculum.
3. COMMUNICATE with mentors, other teams, and businesses to increase STEM interest in our community.
4. ACHIEVE excellence in robotics through a shadowing program that teaches team members coopetition, leadership, and teamwork.

## About FIRST

FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) Robotics is a global STEM organization that gives passionate students the opportunity to enrich their studies in all areas of STEM and build science, technology, and engineering skills. 

In the 2021-2022 season, FIRST® FORWARDSM presented by Qualcomm, FIRST® teams will explore the future of transportation. From the shipment of packages in rural and urban areas, to disaster relief delivery and high-tech air transit, teams will re-imagine faster, more reliable, inclusive, and sustainable transportation innovations that better connect and grow communities and economies around the world.

This year, FIRST teams will address today’s global challenges related to United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #9, focused on building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation. By encouraging FIRST participants to think about future transportation sustainability, we’re also empowering them to be the next generation of leaders and innovators, tackling the world’s toughest challenges.
