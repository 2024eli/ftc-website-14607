TJHSST's FIRST Tech Challenge Team 14607 Robot Uprising is proud to offer two free virtual summer camps, open to the community and general public. Classes are targeted at middle-school aged students, although anyone is free to attend and learn. These classes teach the fundamentals to technology and robotics, through CAD (Computer Aided Design), design principles, advanced manufacturing techniques, working with the Arduino microcontroller, programming in C/C++, and working with simple electronics.

### Classes

Each course has a 5 week curriculum with two classes/week. These semi-weekly classes will run on Monday and Wednesday nights. Registration for both courses is open, and participants may register for either course, or both. 
Classes will run for a duration of 5 weeks from 6/15/2020 - 7/17/2020. 

CAD/Design & Principles: 

- Monday/Wednesday 4:00 - 5:00 PM 

- Learn about the fundamentals of 3D Design with Autodesk Fusion 360 (free software for students)

- Integrating CAD with Advanced Manufacturing techniques, from 3D printing, to laser-cutting, CNC, & more

- Learn Engineering Best Practices and industry design principles and standards

- Important! - Fusion 360 can only be run on Windows/Mac non-FCPSon laptops, as software has to be installed. 

Arduino C/C++: 

- Monday/Wednesday 5:30 - 6:30 PM  

- Learn about how to program in Arduino C/C++ for the Arduino Microcontroller

- Basic virtual electronics instruction, including virtual simulation of LEDs, switches, PWM servos/motors, & more

- Learn advanced object-oriented programming techniques with Arduino C

### Register Here: 

While these classes are free, we strongly encourage participants/their families to donate to the TJHSST Partnership Fund's initiative to support FCPS families during this current pandemic crisis. If you can spare a donation, we, along with the entire TJ and FCPS community, would appreciate it greatly. Donations, from $50, $100 (suggested amounts), or even more, would all be welcomed. 

Please consider donating to this charitable fund. If you choose to make a voluntary contribution, courteously add in the name of "TJ FTC Team 14607 Robot Uprising", with the name of the student, in the donation comment section. (IMPORTANT: to write this comment as part of your donation, check the checkbox specifying "Include a message of support on the fundraising page." on the donation page.)
