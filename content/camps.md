Team 14607 is proud to offer two free virtual summer camps this year, open to the community and general public. 

These classes will run for a duration of 4 weeks during Summer 2020. 

## General Info

For information about Team 14607, please visit our About page.

Team 14607's Virtual Summer Camps are open to the public and general community, and are targeted at middle-school aged students, athough anyone is free to attend and learn. The classes teach the fundamentals to technology and robotics, through CAD, design principles, advanced manufacturing techniques, working with the Arduino microcontroller, programming in C/C++, and working with simple electronics.

Our flyer detailing these classes can be found here: <https://bit.ly/3eejTxE> 

These classes are free, but we ask that you register below beforehand to help us gauge the amount of interest and class sizes.

We also strongly encourage participants/their families to, if possible, donate to the TJHSST Partnership Fund's initiative to support FCPS families during this current pandemic crisis. If you can spare a donation to this benevolent and charitable cause, we, along with the entire TJ and FCPS community, would appreciate it greatly. 

If after taking our classes, you feel that you've learned considerably/gained useful knowledge, please consider donating to this charitable fund. If you choose to make a voluntary contribution, courteously add in the name of "TJ FTC Team 14607 Robot Uprising" in the donation.
