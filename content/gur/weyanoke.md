### Weyanoke Outreach

During Fall 2021 to Spring 2021, the TJHSST FTC Team went to Weyanoke weekly to teach Title 1 students about robotics. 

We originally reached out to Weyanoke for a one time demonstration, but here we are today, helping them start not one, but two FIRST Lego League teams!

Exciting!
